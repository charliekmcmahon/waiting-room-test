# waiting-room-to-telerobot
This is PHP code that is to put gamers to a camera telerobot in a virtual waitingroom, where they can wait for their turn, to remote control it.
It is to be used with a android app called RoboCam.

The queue system is now working and video-stream but only in firefox browser.

The RoboCam app creates a IP adress that make you able to control it over the internet with live videostream.

----My problem now is get the remote control code (from the generated IP adress from RoboCam) 
to the PHP queue file that is called spela.php .---

So I try to get the code from the Android app called RoboCam to work in this PHP virtual queue code.

The PHP code is about ten years old and was running on a debian linux server called FoxBoard.
